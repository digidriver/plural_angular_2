# plural_angular_2

A GitHub repo for the ***Play by Play: Angular 2 Quick Start with John Papa and Ward Bell*** video series I just completed on Pluralsight.com.

This was an insightful and funny video series. If you've been around the block for the past year or two and aren't afraid of typing and breaking code, this series should keep you on your toes as you code along.

# Notes

Check the _.gitignore_ for files that were included/excluded from this upload.
I used Visual Studio Code to build this, in conjunction with Node/NPM.
The codebase is cribbed from John Papa's repo: https://github.com/johnpapa/pbp-a2-ward

***Warning***: if you do clone/fork/download John's repo and try the video series yourself, there _will_ be differences between the repo and the code. It was written before certain things became "best practice"-ish with Angular 2.

Other than that, just as with any other repo you access, *you assume total responsibility for this download*. I ***will not*** be held liable for any issues resulting from you downloading this code (and I'm pretty sure the same goes for John Papa's repo above). Please follow all due diligence to ensure safety of your system.
